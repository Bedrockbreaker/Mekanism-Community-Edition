### Building Mekanism 1.7.10 Community Edition

```bash
./gradlew fullBuild
```
You will find the files inside ./output/

## For modpacks
You need to include the [LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thorfusion/Mekanism-1.7.10-Community-Edition/1.7.10/LICENSE.md) for Mekanism 1.7.10 Community Edition and Aidanbrady as author, if your system supports it indicate that this is an custom version and give appreciable credits

Mekanism CE also has two dependencies that it requires, as a modpack creator DO NOT USE the automatic downloader to get those file. It puts alot of strain to my server network.
