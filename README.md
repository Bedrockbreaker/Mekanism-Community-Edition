# Modpacks, websites, reviews, or anything else #

Some people really don't like others to review or distribute their mods, something which I honestly don't understand.  You are the ones who help get this mod into the Minecraft community's hands, which seems like a good thing from my perspective.
As long as you follow the terms laid out in the license below, go right ahead.  I honestly just don't want you messaging me on IRC or on the forums, asking my permission.  If you need proof, provide a link to this page.

# License #

Licenses are not really my friend -- strict closed source software really drives me nuts.  Even more, with a derivative work coded in a language such as Java, nothing can really prevent people from looking through my source with JD-GUI.  I learned to program through a combination of textbooks, trial-and-error and browsing open source projects.  As such, I have decided to license Mekanism under the MIT license, allowing for anyone with an interest in the project to fork/pull/distribute.
